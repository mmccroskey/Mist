  "summary": "An adapter for CloudKit that supports local persistence, custom typed models, true relationships, & automatic sync.",
  "description": "Mist was created because **CloudKit is great, but it has some fundamental shortcomings**:\n\n* Although it lets you sync records between cloud and device, it doesn't let you save them locally once they've arrived;\n* Although it has a flexible approach to data modelling, that flexibility makes it verbose and error-prone to use;\n* Although it has incredible features for synchronization, they're arcane & opt-in rather than obvious & automatic.\n\nMist seeks to solve these problems by directly supporting **local persistence**, by requiring the use of **typed models with true relationships**, & by providing **automatic synchronization**.",

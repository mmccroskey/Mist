# Mist

Mist combines the best parts of Realm & CloudKit to bring you the simplest possible way to build modern user-data-driven applications.

**Persist Records Locally:**
- [x] Define your models using real Swift classes
- [x] Store records on device in four lines of code
- [x] Query for records quickly and synchronously
- [x] Keep queried result sets up-to-date automatically (no refetching needed)
- [x] Read and write records from any thread

**Keep Local Records Securely Synced with Cloud:**
- [x] Keep records synchronized with a secure server with zero extra code (no more parsing JSON!)
- [x] Optionally store your records so securely that even you the developer can't see them (only the user can)

**Enjoy Automatic User Management:**
- [x] User is automatically logged in at all times (backed by their iCloud user)
- [x] Mist handles iCloud logouts and user switching automatically and transparently
- [x] No account creation, login, logout, password reset, or third party integration code to write

**Share Records Effortlessly:**
- [x] Just set "share" relationship on Record you want to share and then save; Mist does the rest
- [x] User can share Records with any other Users in their Contacts (no Contacts framework permission required)
- [x] User can share Records with anyone on Earth that can open a link (just share the link provided)
- [x] Current app Users receive invite via push and optional in-app UI, can accept or decline
- [x] New app Users taken to App Store to install, then can accept or decline from app

## Usage

To use Mist, start by configuring your AppDelegate appropriately:

```swift

import UIKit
import Mist

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
        
	// We don't catch any errors here, but you definitely should!
	// See [doc section] below for more info
        try! Mist.setUp()
	
    }
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                     didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any],
                     fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
        
        do {
	    
	    // Mist will automatically handle notifications sent by CloudKit
	    try Mist.handleNotification(withUserInfo: userInfo)
	    
	} catch {
	
	    // Handle your app's other notifications as appropriate here
	    
	}
        
    }
    
}

```

Next, you'll want to define you app's schema. With Mist, you define your schema using regular Swift classes. Each Record Type you want to store in your app should have its own subclass of the abstract class `Record`.

Because Mist is backed by [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/), your model classes need to follow all of [Realm's rules for model classes](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#models).

### Example: TinyTask App

Let's say we're building a simple Todo app, which we'll call TinyTask. TinyTask lets Users create Todo Lists & Todos. Todo Lists can be private or be shared with other Users. Todos can be assigned to Users, and can have associated Attachments. Here are the model classes we need to create:

#### Todo

```swift

import Mist

class Todo : Record {
    
    
    // MARK: - Properties
    // Per Realm's rules, all properties have to be dynamic vars.
    // They can be optionals; we just don't need them to be here.
    
    dynamic var title: String = ""
    dynamic var description: String = ""
    dynamic var isCompleted: Bool = false
    
    
    // MARK: - Relationships
    
    // Per Realm's rules, to-one relationships must be optional dynamic vars.
    dynamic var todoList: TodoList?
    dynamic var assignee: User?
    
    // For to-many inverses to to-one relationships, Realm has
    // a LinkingObjects class which automatically stays updated
    // to reflect all the objects that have this object as a parent.
    let attachments = LinkingObjects(fromType: Attachment.self, property: "todo")
    
}

```

#### TodoList

```swift

class TodoList : Record {

    
    // MARK: - Properties
    
    dynamic var title: String = ""
    dynamic var isArchived: Bool = false
    
    
    // MARK: - Relationships
    
    // In addition to using LinkingObjects for to-many relationships
    // as we did in Todo above, you can also use an instance of List,
    // which has to be updated manually, but which preserves order of insertion.
    // We'll use that because we want users to be able to reorder their Todos.
    let todos = List<Todo>()
    
}

```

#### Attachment

```swift

class Attachment : Record {
    
    
    // MARK: - Properties
    
    dynamic var title: String = ""
    
    
    // MARK: - Relationships
    
    dynamic var todo: Todo?
    
    // Mist has an Asset class that's equivalent to CloudKit's CKAsset, except that
    // Mist automatically persists the assets locally so they're always available.
    dynamic var attachedFile: Asset?
    
}

```

#### User

Because every CloudKit Container has a `Users` Record Type, Mist defines a subclass for it out of the box:

```swift

public class User : Record {}

```

Since CloudKit's `Users` Record Type has no properties by default, neither does this subclass. If you wish to add properties, you can do so through a class extension:

```swift

public extension User {
    
    
    // MARK: - Properties
    
    dynamic var firstName: String = ""
    dynamic var lastName: String = ""
    
}

```

### Creating Records

Once you've created your `Record` subclasses, you'll want to use them to create some Records. Let's say you're going to run some errands by yourself:

```swift

// Learn more about Mist.currentUser in [section goes here]
let me = Mist.currentUser

let errands = TodoList()
errands.title = "Errands"

let pickUpDryCleaning = Todo()
pickUpDryCleaning.title = "Pick up dry cleaning"
pickUpDryCleaning.assignee = me
pickUpDryCleaning.todoList = errands
errands.todos.append(pickUpDryCleaning)

let buyStamps = Todo()
buyStamps.title = "Buy stamps"
buyStamps.assignee = me
buyStamps.todoList = errands
errands.todos.append(buyStamps)

let buyGroceries = Todo()
buyGroceries.title = "Buy groceries"
buyGroceries.assignee = me
buyGroceries.todoList = errands
errands.todos.append(buyGroceries)

let groceryList = Attachment()
groceryList.title = "Grocery List"
let groceryListTextFile = Asset()
groceryListTextFile.fileURL = ... // URL to local file on device
groceryList.asset = groceryListTextFile
buyGroceries.attachment = groceryList

```

### Saving & Retrieving Records

Now let's save these Records. [Just like with CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitQuickStart/Introduction/Introduction.html), every Record in Mist must be saved in a Database, and there are three types: 

1. Public
    * This is where you store Records you want everyone to be able to see and edit. 
2. Private
    * This is where you store Records that you want only the current User to be able to see and edit.
3. Shared
    * If another User shares some of their private Records with the current User, those shared Records appear here.
    
Much more detail is available in the [Mist's Architecture Explained](#) section below. Each one of these Database Types has a corresponding class: `PublicDatabase`, `PrivateDatabase`, and `SharedDatabase`. All of these inherit from the abstract class `Database`, and all `Database` instances are backed by `Realm` instances, which means that Databases have the same syntax and rules for interaction as Realm instances do. Here's the Cliff Notes:

#### Saving Records

```swift

let errands = ... // As created above

let privateDb = PrivateDatabase()
privateDb.write {
    privateDb.add(errands)
}

```

See Realm's documentation for more.

#### Reading Records

```swift
```

See Realm's documentation for more.

### Mist Databases

#### How CloudKit Stores Data

As explained in [CloudKit's Architecture Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitQuickStart/Introduction/Introduction.html), each Record stored in CloudKit must be stored in one of its Databases. There are three different types of Database -- Public, Private, and Shared -- and the Database where you store a Record determines who can see and interact with that Record.

All Users share a single Public Database, and all Users can create, read, update, and delete all Records found there.

Each User also has their own individual Private Database and Shared Database. In contrast to the Public Database, Private and Shared Databases are only accessible to the User with which they're associated. Only that User can see the Records in that Database, and that User has full access to those Records.

Therefore, all Users share the same Public Database, but each User has her own Private Database and her own Shared Database. And obviously, a particular Device can only be logged in as one iCloud User at any given time. Therefore, any instance of a CloudKit-enabled application running on a particular device will have access to exactly three databases: one public, one private, and one shared.

Mist reflects this by providing three concrete subclasses of its abstract `Database` class: `PublicDatabase`, `PrivateDatabase`, and `SharedDatabase`.

#### How Mist Stores Data

With Mist, all reading and writing of records is performed against instances of one of these concrete `Database` subclasses. You create an instance of the `Database` subclass that corresponds to where you to look for (or save) Records in CloudKit, and then you call the appropriate functions to do the reading or writing.

**Every `Database` instance is backed by a `Realm` instance**, so the syntax and rules for `Database` instances are just like the ones for `Realm` instances.

##### Reading Data

```swift

let privateDb = PrivateDatabase()

let allTodos = privateDb.objects(Todo.self)
let myTodos = allTodos.filter("creator == %@", Mist.currentUser)

```

See Realm's documentation for more.

##### Writing Data

```swift

let packingList = TodoList()
packingList.title = "Packing List"

let shirts = Todo()
shirts.title = "Shirts"
shirts.todoList = packingList
packingList.todos.append(shirts)

let shoes = Todo()
shoes.title = "Shoes"
shoes.todoList = packingList
packingList.todos.append(shoes)

let hat = Todo()
hat.title = "Hat"
hat.todoList = packingList
packingList.todos.append(hat)

let publicDb = PublicDatabase()
publicDb.write {
    publicDb.add(packingList)
}

```

```swift

let errands = ... // Created as shown above

let privateDb = PrivateDatabase()

privateDb.write {

    privateDb.add(errands)
    
}

```

First we create a `PrivateDatabase`, and then we `add` our `TodoList` to the Database inside its `write` transaction. Adding the `TodoList` automatically adds the other objects we created, since they're related (directly or indirectly) to that `TodoList`. If you've ever used Realm, you'll undoubtedly notice that this syntax is identical to how you use instances of the `Realm` class. This is because **each Database instance is backed by a Realm instance.** 

This means that all the rules about Realm instances also apply to Database instances. Most importantly, this means that **Databases instances (& all Record instances managed by them) are thread-locked.** Once a Database instance has been created, all subsequent interactions with that Database (and any Record instances you fetched from it or saved to it) must occur on that same thread. This sounds ridiculous at first, but is actually pretty simple to adhere to because of three factors:

1. Every instance of a particular Database subclass (e.g. `PrivateDatabase`) points to the same set of data.
    - So just create a new instance of the Database whenever you need to read or write some data.
2. Databases instances (and any objects you fetch from them) automatically stay updated to the latest state of the cache.
    - So if you're using Records from one instance of a Database, and then another instance updates the DB, your instance will instantly have those latest changes without you having to do another fetch.
3. You can be notified whenever the data in a Database changes.
    - So if you're using one instance of a Database to drive a UI and another to write Records in the background, just listen for the change notification and reload your UI when data changes.

#### Fetching Records

You fetch Records using Mist's static `fetch` operation, providing the `RecordID`s of the Records you wish to fetch, and the scope from which you wish to fetch them. Let's say some time has passed and you want to check on your husband's progress to see if he's completed either of his Todos:

```swift

let idsOfHubbysTodos: Set<RecordID> = [buyGroceries.recordID, pickUpDryCleaning.recordID]

Mist.fetch(recordsWithIDs: idsOfHubbysTodos, from: .public) { (syncSummary, recordOperationResult, records) in 

    // syncSummary indicates whether fetching from CloudKit worked;
    // syncSummary is nil by default, but has a value 
    // if automatic synchronization is enabled
    if let syncSummary = syncSummary {
        guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
            fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
        }
    }

    // recordOperationResult indicates whether fetching from the local cache worked
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local fetch failed due to error: \(recordOperationResult.error)")
    }
    
    let buyGroceries = records.filter({ $0.title == "Buy Groceries" }).first
    let pickUpDryCleaning = records.filter({ $0.title == "Pick up dry cleaning" }).first
    guard let buyGroceries = buyGroceries, let pickUpDryCleaning = pickUpDryCleaning else {
        
        print("Some of your husband's Todos no longer exist! I wonder if he deleted them?")
        return
        
    }
    
    if buyGroceries.completed == true && pickUpDryCleaning.completed == true {
        print("Your husband's done with both tasks!")
    } else if buyGroceries.completed == true || pickUpDryCleaning.completed == true {
        print("Your husband's still got work to do...")
    } else {
        print("Hubby seems to have gotten sidetracked.")
    }

}

```

#### Finding Records

Sometimes you don't have RecordIDs, but you still need to access Records that match certain criteria. You find Records using Mist's static `find` function:

```swift

Mist.find(recordsOfType: Todo, where: { $0.completed == false }, within: .public) { (syncSummary, recordOperationResult, todosStillToDo) in
    
    // syncSummary indicates whether fetching from CloudKit worked;
    // syncSummary is nil by default, but has a value 
    // if automatic synchronization is enabled
    if let syncSummary = syncSummary {
        guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
            fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
        }
    }

    // recordOperationResult indicates whether fetching from the local cache worked
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local save failed due to error: \(recordOperationResult.error)")
    }
    
    print("Here are the Todos you & your husband still have to do: \(todosStillToDo)")
    
}

```

Mist also provides a convenience version of the `find` function on `Record`, so you can do the following with Record subclasses:

```swift

Todo.find(where: { $0.completed == false && $0.assignee == me }, within: .public) { (recordOperationResult, todosINeedToDo) in
    
    // syncSummary indicates whether fetching from CloudKit worked;
    // syncSummary is nil by default, but has a value 
    // if automatic synchronization is enabled
    if let syncSummary = syncSummary {
        guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
            fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
        }
    }

    // recordOperationResult indicates whether fetching from the local cache worked
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local save failed due to error: \(recordOperationResult.error)")
    }
    
    print("Here are the Todos you still have to do: \(todosINeedToDo)")
    
}

```

If you prefer, you can also use `find` with an `NSPredicate` rather than a closure:

```swift

let iAmTheAssigneeAndTodoNotCompleted = NSPredicate(format: "assignee == %@ && completed == false", argumentArray: [me])
Todo.find(where: iAmTheAssigneeAndTodoNotCompleted, within: .public) { (recordOperationresult, records) in
    
    // syncSummary indicates whether fetching from CloudKit worked;
    // syncSummary is nil by default, but has a value 
    // if automatic synchronization is enabled
    if let syncSummary = syncSummary {
        guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
            fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
        }
    }

    // recordOperationResult indicates whether fetching from the local cache worked
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local save failed due to error: \(recordOperationResult.error)")
    }
    
    print("Here are the Todos you still have to do: \(todosINeedToDo)")
    
}

```

#### Deleting Records

You delete Records by removing them from the appropriate `StorageScope` using Mist's static `remove` function:

```swift

// Todos created as shown above
let takeOutGarbage = ...
let walkTheDog = ...

let todos: Set<Todo> = [takeOutGarbage, walkTheDog]

Mist.remove(todos, from: .public) { (recordOperationResult, syncSummary) in

    // recordOperationResult indicates whether saving to the local cache worked
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local remove failed due to error: \(recordOperationResult.error)")
    }
    
    // syncSummary indicates whether saving to CloudKit worked;
    // syncSummary is nil by default, but has a value 
    // if automatic synchronization is enabled
    if let syncSummary = syncSummary {
        guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
            fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
        }
    }
    
    print("Todos deleted successfully")
    
}

```

When deleting a Record, deletes may or may not cascade to related Records. Just like with CloudKit's `CKReference`s, each relationship you create has a corresponding `RelationshipAction` -- either `deleteSelf` or `none` -- which is equivalent to `CKReference`'s `CKReferenceAction`.

### Mist's Architecture Explained

### Local Persistence

#### Storing Data

In order to understand the rationale for Mist's approach to data storage, let's remind ourselves of how CloudKit stores things.

##### How CloudKit Stores Data

As described in the [CloudKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitQuickStart/Introduction/Introduction.html), every CloudKit-enabled application typically has one CloudKit Container (`CKContainer`), and every Container has exactly one Public Database (`CKDatabase`), N Private Databases, and N Shared Databases, where N is the number of User Records (`CKRecord`) in the Container. 

*(Graphic Goes Here)*

Therefore, all Users share the same Public Database, but each User has her own Private Database and her own Shared Database. Anyone (whether or not she is authenticated) can read from the Public Database, but to read from the Private or Shared Databases or to write to any of the three Databases, the User must be authenticated.

##### How Mist Stores Data

*(Graphic Goes Here)*

Because a given device can only have one authenticated User at a time, Mist represents this single-User view of the Container via its local cache. The local cache contains one Public Storage Scope, one Private Storage Scope, and one Shared Storage Scope. The Public Storage Scope exists independently of whether a User is authenticated; the other two Scopes (Private and Shared) are tied to the currently authenticated User, meaning that each instance of Mist has U Private Scopes and U Shared Scopes, where U is the number of Users that have ever been authenticated on a particular Device. Mist allows you to interact with the Public Scope, and the Private and Shared Scopes for the current User if one exists.

#### Interacting with Data

When using CloudKit directly, you interact with the data like so:

1. Create an Operation (`CKOperation`) that describes the action you want to perform (searching for records, creating/modifying records, deleting records, etc.), 
2. Set up asynchronous callback closures that handle each result of the operation and then the completion of the operation, and
3. Add the operation to the Database on which you want the action to be performed. 

Mist takes a similar, but more compact and straightforward approach:

1. Call the relevant static function (`Mist.fetch`, `Mist.find`, `Mist.add`, or `Mist.remove`), 
2. Provide the relevant parameter (what you want to fetch/find, or the Records you want to create/modify/delete)
3. Specify where you want to find it (the `StorageScope` (`.public`, `.private`, or `.shared`)).

All of this is done in a single line as parameters to the static function, and all results are handled in a single callback block.

Here are some compare-and-contrast examples.

##### Creating some new Todos & Saving Them

###### CloudKit

```swift

let takeOutGarbageID = CKRecordID(recordName: UUID().uuidString)
let takeOutGarbage = CKRecord(recordType: "Todo", recordID: takeOutGarbageID)
takeOutGarbage["title"] = NSString(string: "Take out garbage") // CKRecordValue requires that we use NSString, not String

let walkTheDogID = CKRecordID(recordName: UUID().uuidString)
let walkTheDog = CKRecord(recordType: "Todo", recordID: walkTheDogID)
walkTheDog["title"] = NSString(string: "Walk the dog")

let container = CKContainer.default()
let publicDb = container.publicCloudDatabase

let modifyRecordsOp = CKModifyRecordsOperation(recordsToSave: [takeOutGarbage, walkTheDog], recordIDsToDelete: nil)
modifyRecordsOp.modifyRecordsCompletionBlock = { (modifiedRecords, deletedRecordIDs, error) in
    
    guard error == nil else {
        fatalError("An error occurred while saving the Todo: \(error)")
    }
    
    print("Todos saved successfully")
    
}

publicDb.add(modifyRecordsOp)

```

###### Mist

```swift

let takeOutGarbage = Todo()
takeOutGarbage.title = "Take out garbage" // Mist allows us to use the String directly, not NSString like above

let walkTheDog = Todo()
walkTheDog.title = "Walk the dog"

let todos: Set<Todo> = [takeOutGarbage, walkTheDog]

Mist.add(todos, to: .public) { (result, syncSummary) in

    guard result.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local save failed due to error: \(result.error)")
    }
    
    guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
    }
    
    print("Todos saved successfully")
    
}

```

##### Deleting some existing Todos

###### CloudKit

```swift

// Fetch existing Todos
let takeOutGarbage = ...
let walkTheDog = ...

let recordIDsToDelete = [takeOutGarbage.recordID, walkTheDog.recordID]

let container = CKContainer.default()
let publicDb = container.publicCloudDatabase

let modifyRecordsOp = CKModifyRecordsOperation(recordsToSave: nil, recordIDsToDelete: recordIDsToDelete)
modifyRecordsOp.modifyRecordsCompletionBlock = { (modifiedRecords, deletedRecordIDs, error) in
    
    guard error == nil else {
        fatalError("An error occurred while saving the Todo: \(error)")
    }
    
    print("Todos deleted successfully")
    
}

publicDb.add(modifyRecordsOp)

```

###### Mist

```swift

// Fetch existing Todos
let takeOutGarbage = ...
let walkTheDog = ...

let todos: Set<Todo> = [takeOutGarbage, walkTheDog]

Mist.remove(todos, from: .public) { (result, syncSummary) in

    guard result.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Local save failed due to error: \(result.error)")
    }
    
    guard syncSummary.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("CloudKit sync failed: \(syncSummary)")
    }
    
    print("Todos deleted successfully")
    
}

```

##### Fetching Todos You Haven't Yet Completed

###### CloudKit

```swift

 let container = CKContainer.default()
 let publicDb = container.publicCloudDatabase
 
 var todosINeedToDo: Set<CKRecord> = []
 var queryCursor: CKQueryCursor? = nil
 
 let queryPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "completed == false")
 let query = CKQuery(recordType: "Todo", predicate: queryPredicate)
 
 func performQuery() {
     
     let queryOperation = CKQueryOperation(query: query)
     queryOperation.cursor = queryCursor
     queryOperation.recordFetchedBlock = { todosINeedToDo.insert($0) }
     queryOperation.queryCompletionBlock = { (cursor, error) in
         
         guard error == nil else {
             fatalError("Error while querying CloudKit: \(error)")
         }
         
         if let cursor = cursor {
             
             queryCursor = cursor
             performQuery()
             
         } else {
             
             print("Here are the todos you still need to complete: \(todosINeedToDo)")

###### Mist

```swift

Mist.find(recordsOfType: Todo, where: { $0.completed == false }, within: .public) { (recordOperationResult, todosIHaveToDo) in
    
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Find operation failed due to error: \(recordOperation.error)")
    }
    
    print("Here are the Todos you still have to do: \(todosIHaveToDo)")
    
}

```

Or even simpler:

```swift

Todo.find(where: { $0.completed == false }, within: .public) { (recordOperationResult, todosIHaveToDo) in
    
    guard recordOperationResult.succeeded == true else {
        fatalError("Find operation failed due to error: \(recordOperation.error)")
    }
    
    print("Here are the Todos you still have to do: \(todosIHaveToDo)")
    
}

```

### Typed Records with Real Relationships

#### The Problems CloudKit Creates

CloudKit is all about storing Records, so it's no surprise that `CKRecord` lies at the core of its implementation. Like CloudKit as a whole, `CKRecord` is intentionally designed to be flexible, and so it acts as a highly mutable container for content: `CKRecord`'s property names, its identifier (`CKRecordID`), and even its type (`recordType`) are all defined as or ultimately backed by Strings, and all properties of `CKRecord` are optional. While this certainly makes things flexible, it has a very significant downside -- it's all too easy to make careless typos when developing with `CKRecord`, and since these typos occur in raw Strings, they'll never be caught by the compiler and thus will likely result in subtle and hard-to-notice runtime errors. It also means that you may end up writing lots of code to ensure that certain properties always have a value, and that that value is of a certain Type, since CloudKit won't enforce that for you.

CloudKit also supports a just-in-time schema in development, meaning that you can create your app's schema simply by submitting objects to CloudKit that match it. Again, this makes things very flexible, but has the downside that a simple typo (e.g. listing a `CKRecord`'s `recordType` as `"Todos"` in one part of your code, but as `"Todo"` in another) can cause you to have a different schema than you intended, and leave you with data distributed in bizarre ways across your Container. And besides, most developers settle on a schema for the app quite early on in development, and then don't change it unless they're already making other major changes to their codebase (e.g. as part of making a major new version of their app).

Finally, while CloudKit allows you to relate objects to one another, they require that these relationships are represented by an intermediary object, the `CKReference`. This means that if you have a highly interrelated data model, you end up doing tons of CloudKit fetches to get an object, and then its related objects, and those objects' related objects, and so on.

#### The Solution Mist Provides

Mist seeks to solves all these problems through its abstract class `Record`, and through conventions about how it's used. `Record` wraps `CKRecord` (meaning it has a `CKRecord` instance as a private property), and enforces best practices around how to create and manipulate `CKRecord`s, as described below.

##### Structure and Conventions for Using `Record`

`CKRecord` is intended to be used directly, and cannot be subclassed. This means that you're forced to interact with every `CKRecord` instance using tons of raw Strings (for property name and `recordType` values) and to write tons of repetitive code to ensure that a certain property's value is of the type you expect, among other disadvantages.

By contrast, `Record` is an abstract class and therefore must be subclassed to be used. Every `Record` subclass follows a couple of simple conventions, and by following these conventions, you get all the advantages you would get with a traditional Swift class. Every `Record` subclass must:

1. Implement an `init` function that calls `Record`'s `init(recordTypeName:String)` function, and passes in the name of the Record Type from your CloudKit Container that this subclass represents
2. Implement all "raw" properties, relationships, and related Assets as computed properties, calling `Record`s respective backing functions within each property's `get` & `set` pseudo-functions

Here's the rationale for each of these rules.

###### The `init` function

By requiring that every subclass of `Record` call `Record`s `init` function and provide a `recordTypeName`, Mist removes the need to provide `typeName` every time you create a Record instance, while still allowing you to decouple the name of the subclass from the name of its respective Record Type in CloudKit. This is particularly useful if you want to follow the typical database vs. ORM convention where database tables (equivalent to Record Types) have plural names (`Users`, `Todos`, etc.), while ORM Models (equivalent to `Record` subclasses) have singular names (`User`, `Todo`, etc.). Whether you choose to follow this convention is up to you.

###### Using computed properties

By implementing "raw" properties, relationships, and Assets as computed properties, Mist allows you to get and set the values of your properties in a way that's ultimately compatible with the `CKRecord` that stores them, while also giving you all the advantages of a proper Swift property. In particular, these properties:

- Have names that Xcode can auto-complete, and can check for correctness at compile time
- Have types that Swift can enforce in both directions, so that you can only set values on that property that make sense, and so that you don't have to check the type of a property's value every time you want use it
- Have explicit nullability, so that if you know a particular property will always have a value (for instance, a boolean flag), you can set it up as such and then you never have to check to see whether it's nil

And in the case of relationships and Assets, you get additional advantages. With relationships, you're able to directly relate two `Record`s together (something you cannot do with `CKRecord`), and then when you fetch the parent Record, you'll get the related Record automatically without another fetch by default. With assets, you're able to access the asset immediately, since Mist guarantees that it remains cached on the device as long as its respective Record is locally cached.

##### Other Advantages of Using `Record`

##### Identifiers

CloudKit requires that the unique identifiers for `CKRecord`s (instances of `CKRecordID`) must be unique to each Record within a given Object Type. However, CloudKit does nothing to enforce this, since the `recordName` property of `CKRecordID` can be any String, and thus could be repeated across `CKRecord` instances.

By contrast, Mist's `Record` has an `id` property, which is an instance of `RecordID` (a typealias of `String`) and is read-only; at initialization time, it automatically gets set to a globally-unique value using `NSUUID`.

##### Record Zones

Although it's not very well documented, proper use of Record Zones is critical to enabling efficient synchronization of objects between CloudKit and the local device. In particular, custom record zones cannot be used at all in the public database, but they must be used in the private and shared databases in order to be able to get efficient change sets for CloudKit updates.

Mist and `Record` work together to ensure that these best practices are followed. In the Private and Shared scopes, root records (`Record` instances that have no `parent` Record) get their own Record Zone, and all the children coming off of that Record are put in that same Record Zone (an implicit requirement of CloudKit). In the public scope, everything is put in the default Record Zone (since CloudKit doesn't allow custom Record Zones in the Public Scope) and alternative approaches are used to get efficient data synchronization.

### Automatic Synchronization

Synchroniziation is typically a three-step process: pulling down records from the server, reconciling them with what's on the device, and pushing new records back up to the server. This reconciliation process can sometimes be complex, but Mist takes a simple approach:

1. Deletes win
2. Latest edit wins
